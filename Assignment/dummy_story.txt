Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom there lived a rich man, who had three sons:
Simeon (a soldier), Tarras (a fat man), and Ivan (a fool).
**add a sentence here** War came to the kingdom and Simeon went off to war. 
But war ended and Simeon, Tarras and Ivan along with their respective families all lived happily ever after.
